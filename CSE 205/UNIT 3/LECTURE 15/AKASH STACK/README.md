Akash has implemented a simple stack using an array with a maximum size of 10.



The program provides the following operations:

Push: Add an integer to the stack.
Pop: Remove an integer from the top of the stack.
Check if Stack is Full: Determine if the stack is full.
Check if Stack is Empty: Determine if the stack is empty.
Exit: Terminate the program.

Input format :
The choice represents the operation to be performed:

1: Push an integer onto the stack. The following input is the element to be pushed.

2: Pop an integer from the stack.

3: Check if the stack is full.

4: Check if the stack is empty.

5: Exit the program.

Output format :
The output prints one of the following messages:

If the choice is 1 (Push), there is no output.

If the choice is 2 (Pop) and the stack is empty, print "Stack is empty!".

If the choice is 3 (Check if Full), and the stack is full, print "Stack is full!", and if the stack is not full, print "Stack is not full"

If the choice is 4 (Check if Empty), and the stack is empty, print "Stack is empty!", and if the stack is not empty, print "Stack is not empty"

If the choice is 5 (Exit), the program should terminate immediately.

If the choice is more than 6, it prints "Invalid choice".



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.
