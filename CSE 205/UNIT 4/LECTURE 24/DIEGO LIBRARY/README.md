Diego is organizing a digital library and wants to categorize books based on the years they were published. He has a list of publication years stored as integers, which he needs to sort in ascending order to make it easier to find books from a specific year. Diego uses a custom quicksort algorithm to sort these publication years efficiently.



Help Diego by writing a program that reads a list of publication years and sorts them in ascending order using the quicksort algorithm.

Input format :
The first line contains an integer N, representing the number of publication years.

The second line consists of N space-separated integers, representing a publication year.

Output format :
The output displays the integers, representing the sorted list of publication years, separated by spaces.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
N > 0

Each year is a 4-digit positive integer.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :

2014 2009 2000 1997 1865
Output 1 :
1865 1997 2000 2009 2014 
Input 2 :
3
1496 3015 2056
Output 2 :
