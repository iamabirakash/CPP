Maria works as a data analyst at a weather research center. She is responsible for organizing and analyzing daily temperature data collected from various weather stations. To facilitate her analysis, Maria needs to sort the temperature readings in ascending order.



Implement a function to sort a list of daily temperatures recorded by the weather stations using the Quick Sort algorithm. The sorted temperatures will help Maria prepare accurate reports and gain insights from the data.

Input format :
The first line consists of an integer n representing the number of temperature readings.

The next n lines consist of a floating-point number representing the temperatures recorded.

Output format :
The output displays a single line containing the sorted list of temperatures in ascending order, with each temperature rounded to two decimal places and separated by a space.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ N ≤ 10

0.0 ≤ temperature ≤ 100.00

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :

32.5 31.0 30.5 29.5 33.0
Output 1 :
29.50 30.50 31.00 32.50 33.00 
Input 2 :
4
25.1 22.2 24.5 23.3
Output 2 :
22.20 23.30 24.50 25.10
