Ravi is spending quality time with his children, teaching them about ascending order through a fun game. To make it more interactive, Ravi has decided to create a simple program that takes a list of characters and demonstrates how to arrange them in ascending order. 



Guide Ravi by implementing this program using quick sort.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the number of characters.

The next line consists of n space-separated characters (lowercase letters or uppercase letters).

Output format :
The output displays a single line containing the n characters sorted in ascending order with ASCII values, separated by spaces.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 26

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
s A a n h
Output 1 :
A a h n s 
Input 2 :
6
h g f d v a
Output 2 :
a d f g h v 
Input 3 :
5
h a p p y 
Output 3 :
a h p p y
