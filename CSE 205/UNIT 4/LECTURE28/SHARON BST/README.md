Sharon is working on a programming project that involves manipulating Binary Search Trees (BST). She is currently developing a program to delete all the odd-valued nodes in a given BST and display the resulting modified BST using an in-order traversal.



Help Sharon complete this task.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the number of nodes in the BST.

The second line consists of N space-separated integers, representing the values of the nodes in the BST.

Output format :
The output prints the in-order traversal of the nodes in the modified BST after deleting all odd-valued nodes.

If odd-valued nodes are not found, print the in-order traversal of the given input values of nodes.

The nodes should be printed using an inorder traversal, separated by a space.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases will fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 20

1 ≤ nodes ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
4 6 2 8 10
Output 1 :
2 4 6 8 10 
Input 2 :
8
44 32 55 87 99 23 12 89
Output 2 :
12 32 44
