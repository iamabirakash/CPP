Revi is fascinated by binary search trees (BSTs) and wants to perform some operations on them. He wishes to construct a binary search tree from a series of positive integers and calculate the sum of all the nodes in the BST.



Write a program to help Revi implement these operations using the BST concept.

Input format :
The input consists of a series of positive integers (greater than zero) separated by a space.

The input ends when -1 is entered.

The integers represent the elements to be inserted into the binary search tree.

Output format :
The output displays an integer value, which represents the sum of all the nodes in the BST.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The input integers will be positive and greater than zero.

The number of elements in the binary search tree will be at most 100.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
3
7
2
4
9
-1
Output 1 :
Sum of all nodes in the BST is 30
Input 2 :
6
3
1
4
2
-1
Output 2 :
Sum of all nodes in the BST is 16
