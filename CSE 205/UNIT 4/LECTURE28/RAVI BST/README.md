Ravi is creating a binary search tree to store unique scores from a recent game. He needs a function to insert each score into the tree and another to display the scores in post-order traversal. 



Write a program that continuously takes positive integers as input, adds them to the tree, and prints the post-order traversal when input ends.

Input format :
The input consists of a sequence of positive integers, each representing a node's score value. The sequence ends when -1 is entered.

Output format :
The output displays the postorder traversal of the constructed binary search tree.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ score value ≤ 1000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
6 3 1 4 2 -1
Output 1 :
2 1 4 3 6 
Input 2 :
1 7 9 5 6 -1
Output 2 :
6 5 9 7 1
