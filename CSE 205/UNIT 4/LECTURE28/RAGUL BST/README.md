Input format :
The first line of input consists of the number of nodes n.

The second line of input consists of n unique values for nodes, separated by a space.

The third line of input consists of the key to be searched.

Output format :
The output displays one of the following messages based on whether the key is found in the binary search tree or not in the following format:



If the key is found in the binary search tree, print "The key <<key value>> is found in the binary search tree"
If the key is not found in the binary search tree, print "The key <<key value>> is not found in the binary search tree"


Refer to the sample output for the exact format.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 10

Each node value is a unique integer.

1 <= key <= 1000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
7
101 102 103 105 106 108 110
102
Output 1 :
The key 102 is found in the binary search tree
Input 2 :
7
101 102 103 105 106 108 110
115
Output 2 :
The key 115 is not found in the binary searc
