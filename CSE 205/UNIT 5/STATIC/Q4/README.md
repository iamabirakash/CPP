Harish has two lists of integers, one representing the number of items sold in two different months. He wants to merge these two lists and sort the combined data to understand overall sales trends. Harish decides to use a sorting algorithm that structures the data into a heap to simplify the sorting process.



Your task is to help Harish by merging the two lists and then sorting the combined list in ascending order. Finally, display the sorted list of sales for Harish.

Input format :
The first line contains an integer n1, representing the number of items sold in the first month.

The second line contains n1 space-separated integers representing the sales data for the first month.

The third line contains an integer n2, representing the number of items sold in the second month.

The fourth line contains n2 space-separated integers representing the sales data for the second month.

Output format :
The output prints a single line containing the combined and sorted sales data as space-separated integers.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n1, n2 ≤ 10

1 ≤ sales lists ≤ 100
