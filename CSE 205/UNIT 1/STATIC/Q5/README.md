You're a coach managing a list of finishing times for athletes in a race. The times are stored in an array, and you need to sort this array in ascending order to determine the rankings.



You'll use the insertion sort algorithm to accomplish this.

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer n, representing the number of athletes.

The second line contains n space-separated integers, each representing the finishing time of an athlete in seconds.

Output format :
The output prints the sorted finishing times of the athletes in ascending order.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 20

10 ≤ finishing time ≤ 120

Sample test cases :

Input 1 :
5
75 89 65 90 70

Output 1 :
65 70 75 89 90 

Input 2 :
5
60 65 70 75 80

Output 2 :
60 65 70 75 80 

Input 3 :
5
90 85 80 75 70

Output 3 :
70 75 80 85 90 

Input 4 :
5
80 85 80 70 85

Output 4 :
70 80 80 85 85
