Naveen is working on a calendar application. He wants to write a program that converts a date from the MM/DD/YYYY format to the DD-MM-YYYY format using basic to class type conversion.



Implement a DateFormatConverter class to handle the conversion. The program should prompt the user to input a date with separate integers for the month, day, and year, and then display the converted date in the desired format.

Input format :
The input consists of three space-separated integers representing the month, date, and year.

Output format :
The output displays the date in the following format: "Date in DD-MM-YYYY format: [DD-MM-YYYY]".



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ date ≤ 31

1 ≤ month ≤ 12

1900 ≤ year ≤ 2100

Ensure the input date is valid.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
11 25 2000
Output 1 :
Date in DD-MM-YYYY format: 25-11-2000
Input 2 :
1 31 1996
Output 2 :
Date in DD-MM-YYYY format: 31-1-1996
