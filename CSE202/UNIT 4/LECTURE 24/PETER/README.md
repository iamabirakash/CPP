Peter is working on a project, and his task is to create a program that takes an input integer representing a total number of seconds and utilizes basic to class type conversion to convert it into a Time object.



The Time class, defined in the code, has private member variables for hours, minutes, and seconds and a constructor that converts the input seconds into these time components.



After inputting the total seconds, the program constructs a Time object and then calls its display() function to print the time in the format "hours:minutes:seconds". 



For example, if the user enters 3661 seconds, the program will output "1:1:1" corresponding to 1 hour, 1 minute, and 1 second.



Company Tag: Wipro

Input format :
The input contains an integer representing the time in seconds.

Output format :
The output displays the converted time as integers in the following format: "hours:minutes:seconds"



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
0 ≤ seconds ≤ 86400

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
3661
Output 1 :
1:1:1
Input 2 :
45034
Output 2 :
12:30:34
