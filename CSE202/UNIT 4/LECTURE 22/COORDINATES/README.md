A teacher in a class implements a program that manages the coordinates of a point in a 2D plane. The program defines a class called Coordinates that stores the X and Y coordinates of the point and overloads the unary ++ operator to increment both X and Y by 1 unit. 



Help the teacher write a program to take user input for the initial coordinates, apply the increment operator, and output the updated coordinates.

Input format :
The input consists of two space-separated integers representing the coordinates X and Y.

Output format :
After applying the decrement operation, the output displays the updated coordinates, separated by a space.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
10 9
Output 1 :
11 10
