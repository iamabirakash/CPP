In a picturesque town, there lived a talented artist named Lily, who had a unique way of expressing herself through strings. She created a CustomString class that could magically invert the case of characters using the ! operator.



One day, a curious writer named Mark encountered Lily's creation and decided to put it to the test. Mark entered a captivating sentence into the console, and the CustomString class worked its charm, displaying the original sentence and its inverted counterpart.



Mark couldn't help but marvel at the power of operator overloading, realizing the endless possibilities it offered for crafting artistic and playful text transformations in their literary adventures.
