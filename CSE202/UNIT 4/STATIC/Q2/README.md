Ethan is driving his car with an initial velocity (in m/s) and suddenly accelerates at a constant rate (in m/s²) for a certain duration (in seconds). He wants to write a program that calculates and displays the final velocity of the car.



Help Ethan calculate the final velocity by overloading the * operator in the Acceleration class.



Formula: Final velocity = Initial velocity + (Acceleration * Time)

Input format :
The input consists of three space-separated double values:

Initial velocity (in m/s)
Acceleration (in m/s²)
Time (in s)
Output format :
The output displays a double value representing the final velocity followed by " m/s", rounded to one decimal place.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1.0 ≤ Initial velocity ≤ 500.0

1.0 ≤ Acceleration ≤ 50.0

1.0 ≤ Time ≤ 50.0

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
10.3 5.0 2.1
Output 1 :
20.8 m/s
Input 2 :
410.2 9.8 4.5
Output 2 :
454.3 m/s
