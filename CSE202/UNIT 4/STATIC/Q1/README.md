Aria is working with a pair of numbers X and Y for her math project. She needs a program to calculate the addition and subtraction of the negated values of X and Y.



Help her create a program that takes X and Y as input, negates them using the - operator overloading, and then calculates and prints the addition and subtraction of the negated values.



For Example:

Assume that X = 10 and Y = 20. The negated values are X = -10 & Y = -20.

Addition: (-10) + (-20) = -30
Subtraction: (-10) - (-20) = 10
Input format :
The input consists of two space-separated integers: X and Y.

Output format :
The output displays two space-separated integers:

Addition of the negated values X and Y
Subtraction of the negated values X and Y


Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
-1000 ≤ X, Y ≤ 1000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
10 20
Output 1 :
-30 10
Input 2 :
-5 -6
Output 2 :
11 -1
Input 3 :
498 967
Output 3 :
-1465 469
