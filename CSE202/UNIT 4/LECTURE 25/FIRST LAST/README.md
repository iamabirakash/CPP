You are tasked with developing a program to process and display full names. The program should accept user input for the first name and last name, create a FullName class using the provided names, and convert the FullName class to a basic-type string FullName fullName(firstName, lastName).



Finally, the converted full name should be displayed on the console.



Note: The program can handle multiple-word names correctly.
