Write a program to create a class Speed that allows users to input a speed value in kilometers per hour (km/h) and then convert and display it in meters per second (m/s). The program should use class type to basic type conversion to achieve this functionality.



Formula:

1km = 1000 meters

1hour = 3600 seconds

Input format :
The input consists of a floating-point number representing the speed in kilometers per hour (k/h).

Output format :
The output displays a float value after converting to meters per second (m/s), rounded off to three decimal places.



Refer to the sample output for the exact text.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1.1
Output 1 :
0.306 m/s
Input 2 :
12.9
Output 2 :
3.583 m/s
