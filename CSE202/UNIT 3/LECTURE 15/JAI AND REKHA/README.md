Jai and Rekha are planning to paint their newly built house and are trying to automate the calculation of their wall area in order to order the amount of paint they might need. 



Help them by creating a Wall class where the length and height of the wall are provided via a setData method. Use the default constructors. Provide a method called calculateArea which would return the area of the wall.

Input format :
The input consists of two space-separated float values: length and height of the wall.

Output format :
The output prints a float value representing the area of the wall rounded off to one decimal place.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1.0 ≤ length and height ≤ 1000.0

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
10.5 8.6
Output 1 :
90.3
Input 2 :
98.77 48.99
Output 2 :
4838.7
