You are tasked with developing a program for a Math competition. One of the challenges in the competition requires participants to find the sum of the squares of the first n even numbers and odd numbers.



Write a program that uses an inline function to calculate the sum of the squares of the first n even and odd numbers. The program should take an input value of n from the user and output the result. You need to implement the necessary functions and ensure that the program handles the computation accurately.



Function specifications:



inline int sumOfSquaresEven - calculates the sum of squares of the first n even numbers

inline int sumOfSquaresOdd - calculates the sum of squares of the first n odd numbers



Note: This is a sample question asked in Accenture recruitment.

Input format :
The input consists of a positive integer N.

Output format :
The first line displays an integer, representing the sum of squares of the first N even numbers.

The second line displays an integer, representing the sum of squares of the first N odd numbers.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ N ≤ 30

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
3
Output 1 :
