John and Michael play a game of multiplication. The game starts with an integer p initialized to 1. They take turns multiplying p by one of the numbers from 1 to 9 in a sequence. John always starts by multiplying p by 1 and then passes the result to Michael. Michael multiplies the number by 2 and passes the result back to John. John then multiplies by 3, and so on, increasing the multiplier by 1 with each turn.



Before the game starts, they draw an integer N. The winner is the player who first reaches or exceeds p >= N during their turn. Write a class MultiplicationGame with a member function void game(int) to simulate this scenario and determine the winner.



Example 



Input: N=10

Output:

10 Michael wins



Explanation

If N is 10:

John starts with p = 1, multiplies by 1 (John's turn), resulting in p = 1.

Michael multiplies p = 1 by 2, resulting in p = 2.

John multiplies p = 2 by 3, resulting in p = 6.

Michael multiplies p = 6 by 4, resulting in p = 24.

Since 24 is greater than 10, Michael wins.
