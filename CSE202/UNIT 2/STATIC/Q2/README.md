Dhruv is a professor who wants to develop a program to manage student information using a class called Student. The program should allow Dhruv to input details about multiple students, such as their names, the number of subjects they have, and their marks in each subject. 



To calculate and display the average marks for each student, Dhruv intends to use pointers to objects in his program. Help Dhruv to write a program.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the number of students.

For each student, the following details should be entered:

The first line of input consists of a string, representing the name of the student.
The second line of input consists of an integer m, representing the number of subjects for that student.
The last line of input consists of m double values, representing the marks obtained in each subject separated by space.
Output format :
For n students, the program should display the following for each student:

The first line of output displays the name of the student.
The next line of output displays the average marks obtained by the student as a double value rounded off to two decimal places.


Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 100

1 ≤ m ≤ 10

1.0 ≤ marks ≤ 100.0
