Dharun is a teacher and has just finished grading the exams of his students. He wants to analyze the performance of his students by finding the smallest difference between the scores of any two students. Help him write the formula that will help him calculate this smallest difference so that he can generate the report for the same using pointer arithmetic.



Function Name: int findSmallestDifference - This function calculates and returns the smallest difference between any two students' scores.



Example



Input:

5

100 89 95 56 66



Output:

5



Explanation:

Here the smallest difference between any two scores (100 and 95), which in this case is 5. This indicates that the closest scores among the students differ by a margin of 5 points.
