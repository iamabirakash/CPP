Karthick is developing a search engine system that allows users to find a substring in a given text document. Users will input the main text and the substring they want to search for.



His task is to implement a program that uses operator overloading (/) to find if the provided substring is present in the given text. Write a program to accomplish this task.

Input format :
The first line contains a string str1, representing the main string.

The second line contains a string str2, representing the substring to search for.

Output format :
The output prints "Substring is present" if str2 is a substring of str1.

The output prints "Substring is not present" if str2 is not a substring of str1.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The length of each string should not exceed 30 characters.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
Programming
gram
Output 1 :
Substring is present
Input 2 :
Television
live
Output 2 :
Substring is not prese
