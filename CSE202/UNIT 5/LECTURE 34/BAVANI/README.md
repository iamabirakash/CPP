Bavani is tasked with designing a simple Vehicle Ride Booking System. The system should have two types of vehicles: "Vehicle" and "MotorBike".



Write a program to illustrate dynamic polymorphism and create two classes: Vehicle and Motorbike. The class Motorbike inherits the Vehicle class.



Create a virtual method called move() in the base class that takes a string as input and prints it.

Override the method move() in the derived class, which also takes a string as input and prints it.

Input format :
The input consists of two strings on separate lines.

Output format :
The output prints the two strings in separate lines.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
Both "str1" and "str2" consist of only printable ASCII characters.

The length of each string "str1" and "str2" does not exceed 100 characters.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
HeroHonda
Suzuki
Output 1 :
HeroHonda
Suzuki
