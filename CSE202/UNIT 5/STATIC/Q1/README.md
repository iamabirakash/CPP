Liam wants to create a program that identifies and counts the number of positive, negative, and zero elements in a dynamically allocated array. 



Help Liam achieve this by designing a program using dynamic memory allocation.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the size of the array.

The second line consists of N space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.

Output format :
The first line of output displays the count of the positive elements in the array with the prefix "Positive count: "

The second line displays the count of the positive elements in the array with the prefix "Negative count: "

The third line displays the count of the positive elements in the array with the prefix "Zero count: "



Refer to the sample outputs for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 100

-200 ≤ elements of the array ≤ 200

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
8
2 -1 0 3 -4 0 5 -7
Output 1 :
Positive count: 3
Negative count: 3
Zero count: 2
Input 2 :
6
0 5 0 8 0 4
Output 2 :
Positive count: 3
Negative count: 0
Zero count: 3
Input 3 :
5
-1 -2 3 4 5
Output 3 :
Positive count: 3
Negative count: 2
Zero count: 0
