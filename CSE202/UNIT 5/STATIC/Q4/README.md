Santhosh is designing a painting application that allows users to select a color and paint on a digital canvas. Your task is to enhance the painting application by adding a user-friendly menu that prompts the user to choose a color to paint on the canvas. The user can input either 'R' or 'r' to select the Red color or 'B' or 'b' to select the Blue color.



Write a program to implement runtime polymorphism. The program should define a base class "Color" with a virtual function "paint" and two derived classes "RedPaint" and "BluePaint" that override the "paint()" function to paint with the respective colors.



The program should use runtime polymorphism to create either a "RedPaint" or "BluePaint" object based on user input and call the "paint()" function to paint with the chosen color.



Note: This kind of question will help in clearing Cocubes recruitment.

Input format :
The input consists of a single character representing the color to paint, where "R" or "r" represents the red color and "B" or "b" represents a blue color.

Output format :
The program should output the message "I'm Painting with Red Color." if the user inputs 'R' or 'r', or "I'm Painting with Blue Color."

If the user inputs "B" or "b". If the user inputs any other character, the program should output "Invalid choice!" and terminate.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The user's input must be a single character.

The user can only enter 'R', 'r', 'B', or 'b' to select a color.

Any other character will be considered an invalid choice.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
R
Output 1 :
I'm Painting with Red color.
Input 2 :
B
Output 2 :
I'm Painting with Blue color.
Input 3 :
M
Output 3 :
Invalid choice!
