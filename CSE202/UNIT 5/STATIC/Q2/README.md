Emma is working on a project that involves analyzing an array of integers to find elements that are divisible by both 3 and 5. If no such elements exist, the program should display 0. She needs to implement a program that efficiently extracts the relevant elements from the array using dynamic memory allocation. 



Help Emma to complete this task.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the size of the array.

The second line consists of N space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.

Output format :
The output displays the elements that are divisible by both 3 and 5, separated by spaces.If no such number exists, 0 should be displayed.



﻿Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 15

0 ≤ elements of the array ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
6
15 30 10 45 6 9
Output 1 :
15 30 45 
Input 2 :
8
9 18 27 45 30 36 21 12
Output 2 :
45 30 
Input 3 :
10
75 120 90 99 25 50 15 3 5 6
Output 3 :
75 120 90 15
