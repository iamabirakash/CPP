Meet David, a computer science student working on a project requiring converting decimal numbers to binary. To simplify his task, David created a class called DecimalToBinaryConverter.



This class contains a method named convert that takes a decimal integer as input and prints its binary representation. David focuses on using early binding for method calls to ensure optimal performance.

Input format :
The input consists of a single integer, n representing the decimal number to be converted.

Output format :
The output should be the binary representation of the input decimal number, printed on a single line.

If the input is 0, the output should be 0.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
0 ≤ n ≤ 109

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
12
Output 1 :
1100
Input 2 :
1485
Output 2 :
10111001101
Input 3 :
0
Output 3 :
0
